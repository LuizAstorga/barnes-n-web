Things we are adding for security:

- Never shipping console logs (this might reveal sensitive information on the client)


Security Features TODO
- [ ] user HTTPS instead of HTTP for backend calls
- [ ] Limit repeated login attempts from same source IP address / host
- [ ] Password minimum requirements
- [ ] Require re-login every thirty days
